# Performance Optimization Summary

## Why the Original Analysis Was Taking Longer

The original comprehensive analysis (`data_analysis.py`) was taking longer due to several factors:

### 1. **Large Dataset Processing**
- **Original**: Full S&P 500 dataset from 1950-present (~18,000+ rows)
- **Optimized**: Filtered to 2010-present (~3,200 rows) for faster processing

### 2. **Complex Feature Engineering**
- **Original**: 12+ features with multiple time horizons (up to 1000 days)
- **Optimized**: 8 essential features with shorter horizons (5, 20, 60 days)

### 3. **Heavy Visualization Generation**
- **Original**: Multiple high-resolution plots with complex styling
- **Optimized**: Essential visualizations with standard resolution

### 4. **Model Training Complexity**
- **Original**: 200 trees with complex parameters
- **Optimized**: 100 trees with standard parameters

## What We Accomplished
